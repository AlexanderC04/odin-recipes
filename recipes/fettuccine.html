    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>¾ pound dry fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>½ cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream</li>
      <li>½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, sliced</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, drained</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1½ cups baby spinach</li>
      <li>crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook fettuccine at a boil until tender
        yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta
        water, and set noodles aside.
      </li>
      <li>Mix together Greek yogurt and sour cream in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and saute until
        fragrant, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and mix in diced
        tomatoes, sugar, and tomato paste. Stir until well combined. Whisk in
        yogurt mixture swiftly. You'll want to slowly add it in, but whisk fast
        to get it all incorporated well. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer
        until sauce starts to thicken, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add baby spinach to sauce and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add
        cooked fettuccine and remove skillet from heat. Toss to coat pasta with
        sauce. If sauce seems too thick, thin with some of the reserved pasta
        water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Top with crushed red pepper to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
